Welcome! This is a collection of functions I have written for data analysis in Aryn Gittis' lab at CMU. 

Functions related to making useful dataframes from Ethovision exports are found in 'ethovision_tools.py'
Functions related to data file and experiment organization are found in 'dataloc.py'
Functions related to behavior analysis are found in 'behavior.py' 
Functions related to plotting are found in 'plots.py'
Functions related to time signal analysis are in 'signals.py' (I.E. clipping pieces of time series based off events.)
Functions related to model fitting are in 'model.py' (I.E. predicting behavior from deeplabcut tracking).

Scripts will have "example" in the file name.
