Welcome! This is a collection of functions I have written for data analysis in Aryn Gittis' lab at CMU. 

Functions related to file organization are found in 'dataloc.py'
Functions related to behavior analysis are found in 'behavior.py'
Functions related to plotting are found in 'plots.py'
Functions related to time signal analysis are in 'signal.py'

Scripts will have "example" in the file name.
